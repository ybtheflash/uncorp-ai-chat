Uncorp AI Chat: Your Secure, Private Gateway to Google Gemini
A secure and feature-rich web client for Google Gemini, designed specifically to be deployed as a proxied alternative for users on corporate networks where official AI websites are often blocked. Uncorp AI Chat provides a familiar, enhanced chat experience with a steadfast commitment to user privacy and a unique, custom-built interface.

üöÄ The Problem
In many corporate environments, access to powerful AI tools like Google Gemini is restricted by network firewalls. This limits the ability of developers, researchers, and other professionals to leverage these cutting-edge models for their work. Furthermore, users are rightly concerned about how their data is stored and used.

‚úÖ The Solution
Uncorp AI Chat acts as a self-hostable, secure gateway. By deploying this application on a permitted domain, users can proxy requests to the Gemini API through a secure backend.

It solves the core problems of access and privacy by:

Bypassing firewalls that block direct access to AI services.

Ensuring data privacy by securely storing your chat history for your convenience. This data is never shared.

Providing secure authentication through standard Google OAuth, which you already trust.

‚ú® Features
