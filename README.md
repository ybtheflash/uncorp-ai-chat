## üöÄ The Problem

In many corporate environments, powerful AI tools like **Google Gemini** are blocked by firewalls. This restricts developers, researchers, and other professionals from accessing the tools they need. On top of that, there are legitimate concerns around how user data is stored and used.

## ‚úÖ The Solution

**Uncorp AI Chat** provides a self-hostable, secure gateway to Google Gemini. It works by proxying requests through a secure backend hosted on an approved domain.

It solves the core issues of access and privacy by:

* **Bypassing firewalls** that block direct access to AI services.
* **Ensuring data privacy** by securely storing your chat history, which is never shared.
* **Using secure authentication** via Google OAuth ‚Äî no new credentials required.
